# Bread Bin
Bread Bin is a simple React Native app designed to help my household manage bread inventory more efficiently. We often find ourselves buying bread when we already have too much, or forgetting to buy bread when it has expired or run out. This app keeps track of bread loaves, their expiry dates, and shows which ones are expired.

## Features
- Add bread loaves with expiry dates
- Visual indicator for expired bread
- Remove bread loaves from the list

Planned future feature: connect to a shared database so family members can update the virtual bread bin from anywhere

## Motivation
I created this project because in my household we always seem to:
- Buy bread when we already have too much
- Forget to buy bread when it has expired or run out

With Bread Bin, the whole family can easily track bread stock and reduce waste.

## How to use
- Add a loaf by entering its type and expiry date
- See which loaves are expired (highlighted)
- Remove loaves when finished

## Future plans
- Connect the app to a shared cloud database so that it can actually be used by myself and my family
- Enable real-time updates so any family member can add or remove bread loaves
- Add notifications to remind when bread is near expiry
